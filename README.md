# Beyond the National Average: A Disaggregated Analysis of Contraceptive Uptake in Kenya (KDHS 2022)

## Overview
This project analyzes contraceptive use patterns in Kenya using data from the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS). It explores differences in contraceptive prevalence by marital status and county, highlights the most commonly used methods, and visualizes national CPR trends from 1993–2022.

## Problem Statement
Despite overall progress in the national Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR), significant inequalities persist across counties and between married and unmarried women. This project provides disaggregated insights to help identify and address these disparities.

## Objectives
1. Compare the most used contraceptive methods among married and unmarried women.  
2. Identify the top six and bottom six counties in terms of modern contraceptive uptake.  
3. Determine the top three most utilized contraceptive methods nationally.  
4. Analyze national CPR trends from 1993–2022.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Folium, GeoPandas  
- **Data:** KDHS 2022, county-level CSVs  
- **Visualization:** Interactive maps and trend graphs  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit (Lovable)

## Key Insights
- Married women mostly use **injectables**, **implants**, and **pills**.  
- Unmarried women prefer **male condoms**, **injectables**, and **implants**.  
- Clear geographic disparities exist — some counties lag far behind the national CPR average.  
- National CPR has steadily increased from 27% in 1993 to 63% in 2022.

## Recommendations
- Strengthen family planning programs in low-uptake counties.  
- Improve supply-chain systems for modern contraceptive methods.  
- Promote education and awareness to reduce social barriers to contraceptive use.

## Project Output
The project includes:
- Interactive **Kenya CPR Map** by county.  
- Bar charts comparing contraceptive use by marital status.  
- National **CPR trend graph** (1993–2022).  
- A Lovable dashboard combining all visuals.
