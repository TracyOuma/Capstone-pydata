# Title: Maternal Health Indicators across Kenyan counties

# What is the problem you are solving?
- Maternal deaths remain a major public health challenge in Kenya, especially in counties with limited access to skilled birth attendants and quality maternal care.
- Many communities still lack the data-driven insights needed to understand where the gaps are and which regions need urgent interventions.
- This project helps uncover patterns in maternal mortality rates and skilled birth attendance across counties, guiding better planning and resource allocation

#  What tools did you use?
- I will use Python for data analysis — specifically:
    •	Pandas for cleaning and exploring the data,
    •	Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing county-level comparisons,
    •	NumPy for simple computations and trends.
- The dataset will be obtained from the Kenya Health and Demographic Survey (KDHS) and Kenya Open Data Portal.
- These tools will help me transform raw data into clear, actionable insights that highlight maternal health disparities

# What insights did you or do you want to discover? What solutions do you want to offer?
- My aim is to discover which counties have the highest maternal mortality rates and how they relate to skilled birth attendance levels.
- The key insight: counties with low skilled attendance rates tend to have higher maternal deaths, showing a clear need for training and deployment of skilled health workers 
in underserved areas.
- The solution: use data to prioritize counties for maternal health programs, improve midwife coverage, and support awareness campaigns to encourage hospital deliveries.
- Yes — people and policymakers need these insights to plan smarter and save lives.

# How would a business or a community (for Social Impact Projects) benefit from your work?
   •	Government & NGOs: can use the findings to allocate funding and staff more effectively.
   •	Health facilities: can identify underserved areas and expand outreach.
   •	Communities: benefit from improved access to skilled care, reducing preventable maternal deaths.
- Value: Informed decisions → targeted programs → fewer deaths → more mothers and children surviving.
